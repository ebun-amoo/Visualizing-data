
Before running these programs, you will need to install Python libraries for `sqlalchemy` and `matplotlib`.

### Pop Charts

(You don't need to modify any code for this one, it's an easy exercise).

Run the `pop_charts_viz.py` program. It will show the song lengths, in seconds.

Looking at the histogram graph, what is the most common length of a song the data set?

### Football Players

Edit the `football_players_viz.py` program, and edit it to filter to a position.

* Look at the player data in the database and get the codes for different positions. Hint: `FW` is for forward, `GK` for goalkeeper.
* Modify the script above, to make plots for each position.

Which position has the strongest correlation between caps and goals? Which position has the weakest correlation?
